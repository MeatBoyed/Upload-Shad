<Steps>

### Run the CLI

Run the shadcn-ui init command and setup your project with Shadcn:

<br />

```

### Add UploadShad

Install the dependant modules

<br />

```bash

<small>This uses the (new) ShadCN CLI to add UploadShad dependencies into your project</small>

### Environment Variable

For UploadShad to upload & delete images in your S3 Bucket, add these AWS configuration Environment Variables to your .env file.
UploadShad ensures that variables without the "NEXT_PUBLIC" prefix remain secured on the server, and are not exposed to the client.

<br />

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST_URL=<http://localhost:3000 ensure you update this in production>
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket name>
AWS_BUCKET_REGION=<bucket region>
AWS_BUCKET_ACCESS_KEY=<your access key>
AWS_BUCKET_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your secret key>
AWS_BUCKET_PRODUCTION_FOLDER=<example folder>
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_BASE_URL=<https://example.s3.region.amazonaws.com>
```
