## Overview

UploadShad is a highly customizable, accessible, and un-opinionated Image Uploader component built for ShadCN Forms and React applications. It provides seamless integration, appropriate form error handling, and un-opinionated method of final uploading of files to storage solution.

**Note**  
UploadShad only handles the implementation of allowing user's to Drop files into your site, and mange the file(s) like a normal Form Input element, while allowing user's to remove and sort (existing) files. This is done to allow UploadShad to be less opinionated on your storage implementation.

## Installation

Follow the [Installation steps](/Installation).

maxSize: number // The maximum size of the files that can be uploaded, in bytes.
handleChange: (uploadedImages: {newImages: File[]; order: string[]}, deletedImages?: string[], newImages?: File[]) => void;
  // A function that is called when the files are changed.
