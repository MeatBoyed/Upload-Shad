## Overview

The File Previewer's responsibility is to

- A. Allow user's to see & delete their uploaded files
- B. Provide User-Friendly DnD support.

#### Preventing unnecessary renders

Previous iterations of UploadShad used the directly uploaded file (image) and attempted to render it and provide
DnD support, but quickly became slow, buggy, and simply un-effective when 5+ images are being used - and that's on a "normal" computer.

For this reason, I made the switch to uploading images, and rending the uploaded url for performance.
Additionally the use of [**Memoization**](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo) is used to store the
Image card components, and [**useRef**s](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef) for Drag and Drop support.

This is done to prevent the component(s) from unnecessarily re-rendering when external/indirect components above, and below
the DOM tree re-render. This is further aided by the use of the [**Context**](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context)
library to access state/data that is needed by it's sibling components.

#### Compound Component

It should be noted that UploadShad is build using the [Compound Component design pattern](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/compound-components-react/),
which allows **you** the developer to decide if having a Previewer is necessary for your use case.

If you need to make your own Previewer that works with UploadShad, simply replicate/copy the Files-Previewer and
change the FilesPreview card.

## Custom Loader

UploadShad renders Images using the [Nextjs Image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image), which allows you to use a Custom Loader.
There are many ways to configure the Nextjs Image Loader, so use what's best for you.

### ImageCard Component

The direct code showing how UploadShad displays image previews

<br />

```tsx
<AspectRatio ratio={4 / 3}>
  <Image
    src={fileUrl}
    alt={`image 1`}
    fill
    quality={35}
    loader={customLoader}
    className="rounded-md object-cover"
  />
</AspectRatio>
```

<br />

### Implementing your own loader

How to directly provide your Custom Image Loader to UploadShad.

<br />

```tsx
import { YourCustomLoader } from "path-to-loader";

<UploadShad {...uploadShadProps}>
  <FileInput {...fileInputProps} />
  <FilesPreview customLoader={YourCustomLoader}>
    <FilesPreview.Head>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Uploaded files</h3>
      <CardDescription>You have no images uploaded yet</CardDescription>
    </FilesPreview.Head>
  </FilesPreview>
</UploadShad>;
```

<br />

### Thats it!

You now understand the high-level design, and implementation of the File-Preview Component. ðŸŽ‰
