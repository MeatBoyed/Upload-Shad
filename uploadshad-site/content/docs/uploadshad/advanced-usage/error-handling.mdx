## Overview

For majority of the errors, they are handled through **React-Hook-Form** (also with Shadcn Form), but there are a few you need to manage.
Learn more about [Errors with React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/faqs#Howtocreateanaccessibleinputerrorandmessage).

## The Errors you should be aware of

### Zod Schema errors

Because ShadCN Forms use react-hook-form, and react-hook-form uses Schemas to define forms - for any custom error messages, you can place them using Zod's schema error handling.
Learn more about [Zod Schemas](https://zod.dev/ERROR_HANDLING?id=error-handling-for-forms)

#### Example implementation

I've found this is all the error management needed in the schema for a "semi-complex" form.

<br />

```tsx
export const MyFormSchema = z.object({
  images: z
    .array(z.string().url({ message: "Invalid Url" }))
    // .min(1, { message: `There must be at least ${MINFILES} Image.` })
    .max(MAXFILES, {
      message: `$t('propertySchema.images.part1') ${MAXFILES} $t('propertySchema.images.part2')`,
    }),
});
```

<small>
  **Note**: This does not handle if the user doesn't provide an image, and you expect there to be at
  least 1 uploaded.

<br />

### Catching Errors for User Feedback

UploadShad does use toasts to provide any errors that can't be send through react-hook-form and zod.
However, because of the accessibility and power of react-hook-form, simply adding a catch all error handler is the simplest
approach to ensuring the user has feedback of any errors.

<br />

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (isDirty && isSubmitted)
    Object.entries(errors).forEach(([key, value]) => {
      // Do something with the error
      toast.error("Oops! Seems you've entered something wrong.", {
        description: value.message,
        duration: 10000,
      });
    });
}, [errors, isDirty, isSubmitted]);
```

  **Displays a toast for the Form Error. This implementation will display all Form value errors.**
</small>

### Creating (throwing) custom Errors

In some cases you may need to implement custom validation for values after the user submits the form.
For these situations, use the [**setError method**]() from react-hook-forms.

This will safely interact with the form state and throw an error.

<br />

```tsx
const {
  setError,
  setValue,
  getValues,
  formState: { isDirty, isSubmitted, errors },
} = form;

async function submitHandler(values: z.infer<typeof FormSchema>) {
  // Add your condition
  if (true) {
    setError("images", {
      message: `Whoops! This is an example error `,
    });
  }
}
```

### Thats it!
