## Overview

UploadShad allows custom styling for the **UploadShad** and **FileInput** components, using the **className** props.

For further customization, feel free to jump into "@/components/uploadshad" to style UploadShad as needed.

### Implementation

<br />

```tsx
<UploadShad {...uploadShadProps} className="w-full">
  <FileInput {...fileInputProps} className="w-full" />
  <FilesPreview>
    <FilesPreview.Head>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Uploaded files</h3>
      <CardDescription>You have no images uploaded yet</CardDescription>
    </FilesPreview.Head>
  </FilesPreview>
</UploadShad>
```

## That's It

Great! Now you can use Tailwind styling to customize UploadShad.
