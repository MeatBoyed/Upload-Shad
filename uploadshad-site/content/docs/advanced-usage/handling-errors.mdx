## Overview

For majority of the errors, they are handled through **React-Hook-Form** (also with Shadcn Form), but are there are a few you need to manage.

Learn more about [Errors with React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/faqs#Howtocreateanaccessibleinputerrorandmessage).

## The Errors you should be aware of

### Zod Schema errors

Because Shadcn Forms use react-hook-form, and react-hook-form uses Schemas to define forms - for any custom error messages, you can place them using Zod's schema error handling.

Learn more about [Zod Schemas](https://zod.dev/ERROR_HANDLING?id=error-handling-for-forms)

#### Example implementation

I've found this is all the error management needed in the schema for a "semi-complex" form.

<br />

```tsx
export const MyFormSchema = z.object({
  images: z
    .array(typeof window === "undefined" ? z.any() : z.instanceof(File))
    .max(MAXFILES, { message: `No more than ${MAXFILES} Images allowed.` }), // Error message if user uploads more Images than specified (MAXFILES)
  imagesOrder: z.string().array().optional(), // Providing error message is optional
  deletedImages: z.string().array().optional(), // Providing error message is optional
});
```

<br />

Note: This does not handle if the user doesn't provide an image, and you expect there to be at least 1 uploaded.

### Submission Error handling

The best approach to ensuring a user has uploaded a File is within the **SubmitHandler** method (works for Shadcn form & React-Hook-Form).
This would also be the best place to do further error handling that you may need.

#### Example

This is the complete implementation for handling a **minimum files** requirment, when also providing default values if it's an update operation.

<br />
Throw a Form Error if validation fails.

```tsx
const {
  setError,
  setValue,
  getValues,
  formState: { isDirty, isSubmitted, errors },
} = form;

async function submitHandler(values: z.infer<typeof VehicleFormSchema>) {
  console.log("Hello!");
  console.log("Submitted Form: ", values);

  if (!initVehicle) {
    if (values.images.length < MINFILES) {
      setError("images", {
        message: `There must be at least ${MINFILES} Image.`,
      });
      return;
    }

    await triggerCreate({ vehicle: values });
  } else {
    if (values.imagesOrder && values.imagesOrder.length < MINFILES) {
      setError("images", {
        message: `There must be at least ${MINFILES} Image.`,
      });
      return;
    }

    await triggerUpdate({
      vehicle: values,
    });
  }
}
```

<br />

Display a toast for the Form Error. This implementation will display all Form value errors.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (isDirty && isSubmitted)
    Object.entries(errors).forEach(([key, value]) => {
      // Do something with the error
      toast.error("Oops! Seems you've entered something wrong.", {
        description: value.message,
        duration: 10000,
      });
    });
}, [errors, isDirty, isSubmitted]);
```
