## Overview

UploadShad renders Images using the [Nextjs Image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image), which allows you to use a Custom Loader.
There are many ways to configure the Nextjs Image Loader, so use what's best for you.

## ImageCard Component

The direct code showing how UploadShad displays image previews

<br />

```tsx
<AspectRatio ratio={4 / 3}>
  <Image
    src={typeof fileState.file === "string" ? fileState.file : URL.createObjectURL(fileState.file)} // Determine if file is a url or local file
    alt={`image 1`}
    fill
    quality={35}
    loader={customLoader ? customLoader : undefined} // Where custom loader method is implemented directly on Image
    className="rounded-md object-cover"
  />
</AspectRatio>
```

<br />

## Usage

How to directly provide your Custom Image Loader to UploadShad.

<br />

```tsx
import { YourCustomLoader } from "path-to-loader";

<UploadShad
  // ...other Required props
  customLoader={YourCustomLoader}
/>;
```

<br />
