The Calendly Dialog is a wrapper & conversion for the Calendly booking link
embedding.

The Dialog is composed to accept a children, which is any component you which to be
the "trigger" for the dialog (like a Button for example).

## Performance Consideration

I would strongly recommend to [Lazy Load (Dynamic import)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading)
the Calendly Dialog component to mitigate any Performance issues.

##### Aside

It is recommended to store your Calendly Link as an environment variable, or in an
appropriate configuration file.
