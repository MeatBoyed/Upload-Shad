## Background

I began my journey into the world of coding with a CodeAcademy course gifted to me by my dad when I was around 13 or 14 years old. This early exposure led me to explore Unity for creating simple games, web scraping scripts, various Python projects which the core Programming Principles and Software Design concepts.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I took on the challenge of building my local church's website using basic JavaScript and CSS, marking my first foray into web development. This project ignited my passion for the field, and I soon immersed myself in learning React.js, Next.js, and integrating third-party applications for feature enhancements, styling, and other essential web development tasks.

## Goals

My primary goal is to work on impactful codebases that make technology more accessible to the general public through smart development. I also aim to generate profit through wise business models and practices. For now, I am actively seeking a job opportunity to further my career and apply my skills in a professional setting.
