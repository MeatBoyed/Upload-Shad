## Overview

The **DataTable** component is a powerful, flexible, and lightweight solution for rendering tabular data in your applications.
Built on top of [ShadCN's DataTable component](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/data-table) which uses
[TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table), this component simplifies the process of creating dynamic tables with rich features.
By leveraging TanStack's column definitions and a list of data, the **DataTable** efficiently generates the specified columns and rows,
eliminating the need for extensive boilerplate code.

With its minimal setup requirements, the **DataTable** provides out-of-the-box support for essential table functionalities, including:

##### Features

- **Sorting**: Easily reorder rows based on any column.
- **Filtering**: Display specific subsets of data by applying filters to columns.
- **Searching**: Quickly find values within a column to narrow down your results.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large datasets with built-in pagination controls.

The **DataTable** is designed to seamlessly integrate into your application, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to handle structured
data with precision and ease. Whether youâ€™re building an admin dashboard, a reporting tool, or any interface requiring data display,
this component streamlines the process while providing a customizable and modern user experience.
